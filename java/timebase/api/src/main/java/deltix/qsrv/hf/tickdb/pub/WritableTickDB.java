 *  (directories) on the hard disk. While the database is closed, the files 
 *  can be freely moved around in order to manage disk space and/or take advantage
 *  of parallel access to several hard disk devices. It is even possible to 
 *  increase or reduce the number of folders, as long as all necessary folders
 *  are supplied when a database instance is constructed. While a database is
 *  open, external processes must obviously not interfere with the files.</p>
