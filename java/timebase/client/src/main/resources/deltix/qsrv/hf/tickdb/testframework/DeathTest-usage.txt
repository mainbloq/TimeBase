This command runs a long cycle of TimeBase data consistency tests, as follows:

    1) Starts a TimeBase process with a simulated data feed loading data at a 
        high rate. If TimeBase crashes (very unusual), the test will stop.
    2) After a few seconds of running, TimeBase is stopped either gracefully or 
        forcefully.
    3) The database files are programmatically scanned with the backend of 
        TB Repair Shop. If shutdown was graceful, we assert that there are no
        discrepancies whatsoever. If shutdown was forceful, we assert that only
        MAINTENANCE level discrepancies are reported. If this assertion fails,
        the test will stop and leave the files untouched for analysis.
    4) The cycle repeats a specified number of times. TimeBase is normally 
        preserved, but is cleared once in a few runs to prevent unbounded 
        data accumulation.


Command-line arguments:

-mode <mode>    Test shutdown mode.
                a - Abnormal shutdown: destroying writer process.
                c - Clean shutdown: closing all loaders and closing db.
                g - Graceful shutdown: closing db without closing loaders.

                Default: all modes. Note that the
                graceful and no-graceful tests are independent tests and should
                both be run in the process of validating a build.

-at <s>         Aggregation time, in seconds. This is the time TimeBase is 
                allowed to run before it is terminated. Default: 10.

-rww <n>        Number of times to run without wiping out TimeBase. Default: 5.

-nr <n>         Total number of times to run. Default: 1000.

-w <path>       Work folder. Default: %DELTIX_HOME%/temp/tbdeath

-db <path>      Path to database instance. Can be used to switch among 
                different types of drives (SSD, HDD), or to run multiple 
                instances of the test in parallel. Default: <work folder>/db
